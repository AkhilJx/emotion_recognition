# Emotion_Recognition_using Keras CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for emotion recognition. The model is trained to identify the following emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise.

Features:
Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras
Dataset used: Face expression recognition dataset from kaggle

Usage:
--> Clone the repository:
--> Cd your-repository
--> Install dependencies:
--> Run the emotion recognition script:

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

Model Architecture: Makes use of Keras Opencv and numpy libraries. The code is divided into 2 parts: one is the model building part using CNN and the other is realtime implementation based on the model developed.

Future Work:
Outline potential improvements or future additions to the project.

Contributors:
Inspired from a github repository.
Feel free to open issues for bug reports or feature requests.

Enjoy exploring emotions with CNN!
